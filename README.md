# Bamboo CSS

A classless CSS framework to write modern websites using only HTML. It weighs **1.52KB** (gzipped).

Features:

- Drop in to use, no configuration, no CSS classes
- Consistent styling across browsers thanks to normalize.css
- Support light and dark theme (automatically detect the OS mode and switch)

Supported in modern browsers. No IE, sorry!

**[Demo](https://rilwis.github.io/bamboo/demo.html)**

## Usage

Add this line to the end of your HTML's `<head>`:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/rilwis/bamboo@1.0.0/bamboo.min.css">
```
