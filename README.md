# Bamboo CSS

A classless CSS framework to write modern websites using only HTML. It weighs **3.3KB** (unzipped).

All it does is set some sensible defaults and styles your HTML to look reasonable. It's perfect for:

- A dead-simple blog
- Collecting your most used links
- Making a simple "about me" site
- Rendering markdown-generated HTML
- Creating demos.

**[Demo](https://rilwis.github.io/bamboo)**

## Usage

Add this line to the end of your HTML's `<head>`:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="link/to/bamboo.css">
```
